# SETUP for modular BMS by simple-ee.com
Here we will choose the bootloader for this board, upload the arduino sketch,
and run through the different serial and I2C commands for both the Protection
board as well as the BMS board.

We will also run through the calibration of the adc inputs to get an accurate
voltage measurement and current measurement.

We will also run through the two different ways of using this system.
1. Using the Protection board on its own
2. Connecting the Protection board to the BMS board for cell level protection


## Bootloader
Here I decided to use the minicore bootloader for the atmega328PB as it allowed
me to configure the arduino with various options, it seems very efficient in 
memory space and also supports the PB variant of atmega328
